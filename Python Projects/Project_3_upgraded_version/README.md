🔥Q. what is venv?
Ans. virtual environment of python is a isolated environment that contains its own python interpreter and its own set of packages. It is used to manage different versions of python and packages, and to isolate the dependencies of one project from the dependencies of another project. 

📌Note: 
i. Python is very strict about where it looks for packages, so you need to tell it to look in a specific  folder called "venv" that is next to your project folder.

ii. Python is very strict in Indentation, so don't forget to add 4 spaces or 1 tab before each line of code.
