# 🔴 Password Guessing Game

1. What Are We Building?

   Ans. A simple text-based game where:
   1. The computer picks a secret password (word).
   2. The user keeps guessing the word.
   3. After each guess, the program gives a hint about how close the guess is (e.g., how many letters are correct and in the correct place).
   4. The game counts how many guesses it took.
   5. You can add different difficulty levels (shorter or longer passwords).

2. How Does It Work?

   Ans. Step-by-step:
   1. The program chooses a secret password (e.g., "banana").
   2. The user is told how many letters the word has.
   3. The program asks the user to guess the word.
   4. After each guess:
      - If correct, the user wins and the program shows the number of attempts.
      - If not, the program gives a hint (e.g., "2 letters are correct and in the right place").
   5. The game continues until the user guesses the password correctly.
