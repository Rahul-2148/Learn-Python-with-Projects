🔴 Password Guessing Game 

1. What Are We Building?

Ans. A simple text-based game where:
     . The computer picks a secret password (word).
     . The user keeps guessing the word.
     . After each guess, the program gives a hint about how close the guess (e.g., how many letters are     correct and in the correct place).
     . The game counts how many guesses it took.
     . You can add different difficulty levels (shorter or longer passwords).

2. How Does It Work?

Ans. Step-by-step:
     1. The program chooses a secret password (word) (e.g., "banana").
     2. The user is told how many letters the word has.
     3. The program asks the user to guess the word.
     4. After each guess:
         - If correct, the user wins and the program shows the number of attempts.
         - If not, the program gives a hint (e.g., "2 letters are correct and in the right place").
     5. The game continues until the user guesses the password correctly.

🔥Bonus: Add a feature where the user can choose the difficulty level (shorter or longer passwords).
